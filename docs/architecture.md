# Architecture Overview

## Implementation Status

This document outlines both currently implemented architecture components and planned future enhancements. Features marked with ðŸš§ TODO are planned for future implementation.

## System Overview
The system provides a real-time chat interface with feature steering capabilities, allowing users to adjust model behavior through feature controls and save configurations as model variants. It also includes a TestBench system for A/B testing different UI/UX implementations (ðŸš§ TODO).

    participant U as User
    participant CI as Chat.tsx
    participant CC as /chat/completions
    participant FI as /features/inspect
    
    U->>CI: Send Message
    CI->>CC: POST Request
    CC-->>CI: Print Response
    CI->>FI: POST Request
    FI-->>CI: Show Feature Activations
```

### Steering Flow
