# Components Documentation

## Current Implementation Status

This document outlines both currently implemented features and planned future enhancements. Features marked with 🚧 TODO are planned for future implementation.

## Frontend Components

### Chat Interface ✓
- Main user interaction point for conversations
- Handles message input/output
- Manages chat history display
- Triggers feature inspection on new messages
- Integrates with current model variant settings for completions

### Inspector Panel ✓
- Displays current feature activations
- Provides controls for feature adjustment
- Updates in real-time as messages are processed
- Shows feature search and filtering options

### TestBench Control Panel 🚧 TODO
- Manages UI/UX testing configurations
- Controls A/B testing of different component versions
- Provides real-time component switching
- Enables quick iteration on UI/UX changes

### Connection Status ✓
- Displays system connectivity state
- Shows real-time connection health
- Indicates ongoing operations

## Backend Services

### Chat Completion Service ✓
- Handles LLM interactions
- Manages basic responses (🚧 TODO: Streaming responses)
- Integrates model variant settings into completions
- Basic error handling (🚧 TODO: Retry logic and advanced error cases)

### Feature Management Service ✓
- Provides a secure wrapper around the Ember SDK
- Controls feature inspection and steering through SDK methods
- Manages feature activation calculations via SDK
- Handles feature modification requests with basic error handling
- Coordinates with model variant system
- 🚧 TODO: Rate limiting and usage monitoring
- 🚧 TODO: Advanced SDK version compatibility handling

### TestBench Service 🚧 TODO
- Manages UI/UX test configurations
