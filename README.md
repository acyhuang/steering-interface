# steering-interface
 
TODO (next actions): 

SMALL FIXES:
- add tests to variantcontext.test.tsx to test that isComparing state is correct
- handle steering feature to 0 (don't want to show as an active steer)
- if cancel steering, update the activations in whichever tab where they were modified

## LOG
- `04-09`: finish steering comparison
