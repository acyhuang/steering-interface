# steering-interface
 
**TODO (next actions):** 
- side-by-side add summary of differences
- fix autosteer, allow toggle on/off?
- refactor feature state management by extending VariantContext

**SMALL FIXES:**
- add tests to variantcontext.test.tsx to test that isComparing state is correct
- handle steering feature to 0 (don't want to show as an active steer)
- if cancel steering, update the activations in whichever tab where they were modified
- paginated search / show more?

## LOG
- `04-09`: implement side-by-side steering comparison
