# steering-interface
 
**TODO (next actions):** 
- small frontend fixes
- audit everything 
- fix loading states
- rethink autosteer mechanism
- side-by-side add summary of differences
- in comparison view, subtle highlight the differences in the steered response

**LATER:**
- tooltip to try enhancing your response? (prompt controls from chat)
- show feature editor always to prompt user to edit
- handle steering feature to 0 (don't want to show as an active steer)
- if cancel steering, update the activations in whichever tab where they were modified
- paginated search / show more?
